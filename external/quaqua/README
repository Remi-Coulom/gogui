This directory contains the Quaqua Look And Feel from
http://www.randelshofer.ch/quaqua/download.html.
Due to its size, a copy is not included in the GoGui SVN repository
(however it is included in the GoGui releases).
If you checked out the GoGui sources from SVN, download the Quaqua zip-file
with the version used in build.xml and copy it here.
