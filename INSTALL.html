<h1>GoGui Installation Notes</h1>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>
GoGui requires at least Java version 5. The recommended Java runtime
environment is Sun's Java SE 6 or a new version of OpenJDK (it might work on
older versions of OpenJDK but there can be minor rendering issues, e.g. the
stones on the board are not completely round).
</p>
<p>
GoGui comes with precompiled Java jar files for GoGui and the GTP tools
in the lib directory. GoGui does not necessarily need to be installed on the
system, it can be run from the directory where the distribution file was
extracted to.
</p>
<p>
For Unix systems there are launcher scripts in the bin directory.
The launcher scripts respect the environment variable GOGUI_JAVA_HOME, if
defined, and look for the jar files relative to the bin directory.
</p>

<h2>Installation on Linux</h2>
<p>
For Linux, there is an installation script <tt>install.sh</tt>, which installs
GoGui into the system directories and integrates it into the desktop
environment. This script needs to be run as root and requires the option
<tt>-j</tt> with the location of a Java 5 compatible virtual machine.
</p>
<p>
On Ubuntu 9.10, it is recommended to install the package sun-java6-jre
in the Synaptic package manager, and then install GoGui by running the command:
<blockquote>
<tt>sudo ./install.sh -j /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun</tt>
</blockquote>
On Ubuntu 10.4, the package sun-java6-jre has been moved to the partner
repository. You first have to add the partner repository by running the
command:
<blockquote>
<tt>sudo add-apt-repository "deb http://archive.canonical.com/ lucid partner"</tt>
</blockquote>
</p>

<h2>Installation on Windows</h2>
<p>
A Windows installer is available from GoGui's project page.
</p>

<h2>Installation on Mac OS</h2>
<p>
A Mac application bundle can be created by compiling GoGui from the sources
(see below) and running
<blockquote>
<tt>ant gogui.app</tt>.
</blockquote>
</p>

<h2>Compiling from the Sources</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Compiling GoGui from the sources needs the
<a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant build system</a>.
</li>
<li>
The HTML documentation is generated using Docbook.
This requires that the XSL transformer
<a href="http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT">xsltproc</a> and the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/docbook/files/docbook-xsl/">Docbook
XSL Stylesheets</a> are installed.
The location of the Docbook XSL directory can be defined with the
ant option -Ddocbook-xsl.dir=directory (default is
/usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/docbook-xsl).
</li>
<li>
If the GoGui sources were checked out from the repository, the Quaqua Look and
Feel (http://www.randelshofer.ch/quaqua/) needs to be downloaded and copied to
external/quaqua. See the property quaqua.nestedzipfile in build.xml for the
version needed. For building GoGui with limited support for the Mac, Quaqua
can be disabled by invoking ant with the option -Dnoquaqua=true. GoGui will
use Quaqua if it finds the file quaqua.jar in the same directory as gogui.jar,
so it is still possible to manually copy it there later.
</li>
<li>
If all requirements are met, simply type <tt>ant</tt> in the main directory of
GoGui.
</li>
</ul>
