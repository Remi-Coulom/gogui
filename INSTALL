Basics
======

This package requires at least Java version 1.4.
It comes with precompiled Java jar files for GoGui and the GTP tools
and in the lib directory.
GoGui does not necessarily need to be installed on the system, it can
be run from the directory, where the distribution file was extracted to.
For Unix systems there are launcher scripts in the bin directory.
The launcher scripts respect the environment variable GOGUI_JAVA_HOME, if
defined, and look for the jar files relative to the bin directory.

Installation on Linux
=====================

For Linux, there is an installation script install.sh, which installs
GoGui into the system directories and integrates it into the desktop
environment. This script needs to be run as root and requires the option -j
with the location of a Java 1.4 compatible virtual machine.

Installation on Mac OS
======================

A Mac application bundle can be created by compiling GoGui from the sources
(see below) and running "ant gogui.app".

Compiling from the Sources
==========================

* Compiling GoGui from the sources needs the Ant build system
  (http://ant.apache.org).

* The HTML documentation is generated using Docbook.
  To re-generate the HTML files after changes in the XML files,
  the XSL transformer "xsltproc" (http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT) has to be
  installed.
  The built in ant target "Style" is no longer used, because it has problems
  with newer versions of Docbook XSL and also replaces some HTML entities in
  a way that the Java JEditorPane does not render correctly.

* If all requirements are met, simply type "ant" in the main directory
  of GoGui.
